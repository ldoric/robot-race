# RobotRace

![Robot Race Banner](https://github.com/mjospovich/robot-race/blob/main/assets/banner.PNG)

Welcome to RobotRace, a C++ console application that simulates a robot race through a maze. 
<br>Each robot, represented by letters A-D, competes to be the first to reach the finish line.
<br>And.. yes you can use it as a gambling game!

## Features

- **Multiple Levels**: Choose from three different maze sizes: Small, Medium, and Large.
- **Customizable Robot Entries**: Select 2-4 robots to enter the race.
- **Placement Options**: Decide on manual or automatic placement of robots within the matrix.
- **Real-time Progression**: Watch each move unfold on your screen as the robots navigate the maze.
- **Max Moves Limit**: The race is capped at 100 moves to ensure a swift outcome.
- **Replayability**: Post-race, opt to view a replay, export the robot's moves, run another race, or exit the application.
